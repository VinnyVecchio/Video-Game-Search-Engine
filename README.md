# Video-Game-Search-Engine
This is my first application of a video game search engine

<h1>Game Wizdom</h1>


<p>Welcome to my video game search engine!

This search engine was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for their favorite video games and see relevant information about them, such as the release date and publisher.

To use the search engine, simply type in the name of the video game you are looking for in the search bar and hit enter. The search results will be displayed on the page.

I hope you enjoy using my video game search engine! If you have any suggestions or encounter any issues, please feel free to let me know.</p>

<h1>why i built the application</h1>
<p>The reason i built this application was because i have been playing videogames for well... almost my whole life from the time i was a child
even until today, one thing i always found the issue was was trying to find a easy simple solution to finding basic information about the
game. I didnt need all the fluff, just a basic description of what it was about, a release date, maturity rating, and the team that made the game </p>
